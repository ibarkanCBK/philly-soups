              <p>Philly Soups is a full service bar and restaurant in Philadelphia- serving real food to real people. Soup Kitchen was started with the purpose of providing accessible food to diners looking for  quality American fare. A ‘from scratch’ operation with fresh squeezed juice and small batch soups, we serve what we would like to eat ourselves. We use local produce when practical and do our part as a community hub. We sincerely care about what we are doing and practice sustainable operations like composting food waste.  </p>
